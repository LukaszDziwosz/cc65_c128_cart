# CC65 C128 Cartridge Template

16KB and 32KB cartridge setup for the Commodore 128 using CC65

Inspired by C64 version here: https://github.com/jviskari/cc65cart

Program will boot in both 40 and 80 column modes.

On Mac and Linux just "make run" and it will start in VICE 128



Known issue:

Currently I can't figure out safe way to return to BASIC, Exit option will restart the program.
